# Bachelor Thesis - Sentiment Analysis of Public Opinion on the Relocation of the Capital City in Indonesia through YouTube Video Comments Using Word2Vec Embeddings in a Hybrid CNN-LSTM


The development of information technology has made social media one of the main platforms for people to express their opinions and feelings regarding various social and political issues. One of the topics that has become the main focus in Indonesia is the plan to move the country’s capital. This research aims to analyze public sentiment towards the plan to move the country’s capital through video comments on the YouTube platform. The method used involves the Word2Vec Embeddings technique to convert comment text into numerical vectors that represent the semantic meaning of words. Next, the resulting vector is used as an input feature for the Hybrid CNN-LSTM model, a combination of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to classify sentiment as positive , negative, or neutral. The results of the analysis show a variety of sentiments from the public towards the plan to move the nation’s capital, with several main reasons driving positive, negative or neutral feelings. The Hybrid CNN-LSTM model can predict new input comments with an accuracy of 73%. These findings provide valuable insights for stakeholders to understand the community’s views more deeply and prepare more effective communication strategies in conveying information regarding the plan.
